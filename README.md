# Gatsby Ceiphr

This is a Gatsby blog designed by Ari Birnbaum for ceiphr.com. This project is based on [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). The majority of the Sass and some of the components for this project are derived from [gatsby-theme-ceiphr](https://github.com/ceiphr/gatsby-theme-ceiphr) (deprecated, used a headless Ghost CMS). The blog tempplate's article heading was inspired by [Valorant's news site](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/what-is-the-valorant-battlepass/). This project is hosted on Vercel.

## Quick start

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

   Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

   ```shell
   # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
   gatsby new gatsby-ceiphr https://github.com/ceiphr/gatsby-ceiphr
   ```

1. **Start developing.**

   Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

   ```shell
   cd gatsby-ceiphr/
   gatsby develop
   ```

1. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   _Note: You'll also see a second link:_ `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

   Open the `gatsby-ceiphr` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
