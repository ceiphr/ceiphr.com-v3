## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will leverage a security-oriented workflow for your Django development by implementing and configuring environment-based settings, `dotenv`, and Djangoâ€™s built-in security settings. These features all complement each other and will result in a version of your Django project that is ready for different approaches you may take to deployment.
